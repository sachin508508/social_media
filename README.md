SocialBook

SocialBook is a basic social media application developed purely with front-end technologies. It currently lacks functionality such as posting updates, liking posts, and commenting. While the buttons for these features are present in the interface, they are not implemented and serve as placeholders for future development. This project was initially created by following a YouTube tutorial and serves as a starting point for learning front-end development.

Features
User Interface: A simple interface with buttons for posting updates, liking posts, and commenting, though the functionality is not yet implemented.
Technologies Used
HTML: Markup language for structuring the application's layout.
CSS: Styling language for designing the application's appearance.
JavaScript: Programming language for implementing interactive features.
Usage
To use SocialBook, open the index.html file in your web browser. You can navigate through the interface and observe the layout and functionality, albeit incomplete.

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sachin508508/socialbook.git
